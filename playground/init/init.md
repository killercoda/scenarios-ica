This playground has Istio installed on Kubernetes

Also the demo app [Bookinfo](https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/bookinfo/) is installed in the `default` namespace.

This was created as my own personal prepration for ICA and as I understand from the reviews, the exam is heavily hands-on based with a lot of tasks and little time to do them. I therefore try to get as much exercises as possible.
