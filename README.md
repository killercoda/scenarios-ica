# Killercoda Istio ICA

This is the repository for the scenarios available on [killercoda.com/ica-scenarios](https://killercoda.com/ica-scenarios)

Here are some [docs on the Istio Certified Associate (ICA)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/istio-certified-associate-ica/)

This environment is created by people why try to prepare for the certification and not the creators. Bear in mind, that more learning than this simulator should be done.
